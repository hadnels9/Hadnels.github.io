        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p><strong>Prompt: </strong> What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p><strong>Response:  </strong> For this class I hope to achieve a more advanced understanding of css, html and javascript, and in general be able to problem solve the process of website building without wanting to throw my computer off a building. I don’t have any particular projects or technologies I’d like to see covered but I really struggle with javascript so any extra help with that is appreciated. There are definitely a couple websites such as Woven magazine, Hidden Characters clothing and LQQK studio (this one in particular) that really inspire and cause a reaction for me. </p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p><strong>Prompt: </strong> What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter? </p>
        <p> <strong>Response:</strong> For project one I’m looking to do something fun and playful, my topic is going to be frogs with hats. The content will either be a collage of imagery or an image as the focal point followed with the written content of a bio about each unique hatted frog. The color will follow a cool toned theme and have general symmetry to visual imagery to unify the project but utilize slight variations to differentiate each page. The color will be cool toned referenced in nature to exemplify the natural topic with a pop of bright tone, type will be funky and playful, as well as imagery to cover the fun and silly topic in a unique way. </p>

Most likely this user is young, familiar with the unusual nuances of the internet and down for a frog and hat filled time.</p>
