        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p><strong>Prompt: </strong> What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p><strong>Response:  </strong> For this class I hope to achieve a more advanced understanding of css, html and javascript, and in general be able to problem solve the process of website building without wanting to throw my computer off a building. I don’t have any particular projects or technologies I’d like to see covered but I really struggle with javascript so any extra help with that is appreciated. There are definitely a couple websites such as Woven magazine, Hidden Characters clothing and LQQK studio (this one in particular) that really inspire and cause a reaction for me. </p>
        <p><strong>Inspiring site of the week: </strong> <a href="http://www.lqqkstudio.com/">LQQK Studio</a></p>
